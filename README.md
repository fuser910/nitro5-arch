# Installing Arch Linux on Acer Nitro 5 step by step
This guide will focus on me installing Arch Linux on my laptop Acer Nitro 5 AN515-45-R5C7 which have AMD Ryzen 7 5800H Processor with NVIDIA Gefore RTX3070 Mobile GPU.

## Preparing the Bootable USB
1. First and foremost, you need to have a USB Stick/Flash Drive whatever you call it minimum for Arch Linux is 1GB but it is nice to have bigger just so you can try other iso as well in same USB.
2. Download Ventoy based on your current OS and run it.
3. Since most of laptop prefer UEFI GPT setup you need to change the partition style to GPT on Ventoy setting before installing.
